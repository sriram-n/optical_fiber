P. Gatto, Jan 2015.

Minor polishing of DPG project. Added call to Paraview graphics. If you run
into trouble with compiling/linking/running, see src/graphics/paraview/README.

Main drivers are:

  ./poissonDPG.sh   --> DPG for Poisson problem
  ./reac_diffDPG.sh --> DPG for reaction-diffusion problem

Run ./help.sh for a list of all the parameters accepted by the executable.
